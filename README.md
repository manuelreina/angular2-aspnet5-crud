# angular2-aspnet5-crud (outdated)

This progressive web app is composed of 2 pages, the home page and a simple CRUD page.

**BUILT WITH**

 - Angular 2
 - ASP.NET Core
 - Angular Universal
 - Progressive Web Apps
 - Webpack
 - Grunt


I have written this [post](http://manuelreina.github.io/angular-universal-asp-net-core-pwa/) which summarizes all the steps and the issues I had in order to put everything together.

You can see the demo [here](https://angularuniversal-vnext.azurewebsites.net/). It's a free azure resource, so sorry for the slow load time.
